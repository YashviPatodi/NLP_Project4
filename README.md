# "Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn,and Folium"

This project presents a concise approach to data visualization using Python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to create clear and impactful visual representations.

Key Visualization Types:

    -Pie and Stacked Bar Charts: Highlight category proportions and distributions effectively.
    -Heatmaps and Scatter Plots: Reveal data patterns and relationships with intuitive color gradients and point clusters.
    -Geospatial Mapping: Use Folium for spatial analysis, mapping data points and density.
    -Venn Diagrams: Illustrate set relationships and intersections.
Core Objectives:

    -Effective Visuals: Produce clear and relevant representations.
    -Geospatial Analysis: Map data locations and density.
    -Data Structure Clarity: Use sunburst and network diagrams for hierarchy and relationships.
